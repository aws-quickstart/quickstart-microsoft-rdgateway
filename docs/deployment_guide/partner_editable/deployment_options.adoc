// Edit this placeholder text as necessary to describe the deployment options.

This Partner Solution provides the following deployment options:

* https://fwd.aws/66VB5?[Deploy {partner-product-short-name} into a new VPC^]. This option builds a new AWS environment that consists of the VPC, subnets, NAT gateways, security groups, bastion hosts, and other infrastructure components. It then deploys {partner-product-short-name} into this new VPC.
* https://fwd.aws/QmmJN?[Deploy {partner-product-short-name} into an existing VPC^]. This option provisions {partner-product-short-name} in your existing AWS infrastructure.
* https://fwd.aws/EwEqm?[Deploy domain-joined {partner-product-short-name} into an existing VPC^]. This is similar to the second option, except that it provides domain-joined {partner-product-short-name} instances in the existing VPC, and provides a few additional parameters for customizing this configuration.

This Partner Solution provides separate templates for these options. It also lets you configure Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) blocks, instance types, and {partner-product-short-name} settings.
